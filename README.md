Library Management using basic python

The script begins with a welcome message and prompts the librarian to input their name and library code.
The user is then asked to input their personal details, including name, age, gender, date, address, and phone number. The script includes checks to ensure the age is between 5 and 100, the gender is either male or female, the date is in either 2020 or 2021, and the phone number is 10 digits long.
The script displays a list of book types available in the library, such as general books, novel books, fantasy and comic books, action and adventure books, and horror, detective, and mystery books. The user is asked to select a type of book they recommend.
If the user selects 'general book', they are shown a list of books in this category, including an encyclopedia, a general knowledge quiz book, and an Oxford dictionary. The user can select a book, and the script will display the title, author, account number, and type of the book.
